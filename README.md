# Creating-a-Dictionary
In this project, I created a dictionary in python and connected the dictionary to two databases. One keeps the vocabularies and their definition and another keeps the username and passwords of people who registered and are member of the club of dictionary. Only members can insert, remove and modify words in the dictionary.
