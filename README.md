# Creating-a-Dictionary
In this project, I created a dictionary in python and connected the dictionary to two databases. One keeps the words and their definition and another keeps the username and passwords of people who registered to the club of dictionary. Only people who have registered can insert, remove and modify words in the dictionary.
